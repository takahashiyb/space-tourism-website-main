## Overview

### The challenge

Your challenge is to build out this multi-page space tourism website and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

**This project is a collaboration between us, Scrimba, and Kevin Powell. If you'd like to see how Kevin would tackle the project, you can [follow along on Scrimba's free course](https://scrimba.com/learn/spacetravel).**

If you're working through it yourself, please use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

If you choose to use a JS-heavy approach, we provide a local `data.json` file for the different page data. This means you'll be able to pull the data from there instead of using the separate `.html` files.

Your users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- SCSS
- Animations with @keyframes

### What I learned

I learned of basic keyframe animations and about reflow using offsetWidth.

### Continued development

A framework was not used since I decided it is best to stick with basic Javascript for now. Though making use of a framework will learned after doing enough research on each's specific advantages. There were also need to brush up on layouts and recognizing patterns and differences.
